A. J. Jacobs     I have little shame, no dignity - all in the name of a better cause.
A. J. Jacobs     The best we can do, to paraphrase Pollan, is to eat whole foods, mostly plants, and not too much.
A. J. Jacobs     I tried the paleo diet, which is the caveman diet - lots of meat. And I tried the calorie restriction diet: The idea is that if you eat very, very little - if you're on the verge of starvation, you will live a very long time, whether or not you want to, of course.

A. P. J. Abdul Kalam     The world has today 546 nuclear plants generating electricity. Their experience is being continuously researched, and feedback should be provided to all.

Aaron Eckhart     I often feel that my days in New York City, that I was here for five years, didn't get one job, went on a thousands of auditions and literally did not get a job on a soap, not a movie, not TV, not nothing, although I did do some commercials thank God.
Aaron Eckhart     It seems to me if you want something badly enough, whether you're a man or a woman, you'll do whatever you have to do to get it.

Abba Eban     I think that this is the first war in history that on the morrow the victors sued for peace and the vanquished called for unconditional surrender.
Abba Eban     History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely once they have exhausted all other alternatives.
Abba Eban     If Algeria introduced a resolution declaring that the earth was flat and that Israel had flattened it, it would pass by a vote of 164 to 13 with 26 abstentions.
Abba Eban     One of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all.
Abba Eban     Time and again these governments have rejected proposals today - and longed for them tomorrow.
Abba Eban     Better to be disliked than pitied.
Abba Eban     A consensus means that everyone agrees to say collectively what no one believes individually.
Abba Eban     You can't achieve anything without getting in someone's way.
Abba Eban     A statesman who keeps his ear permanently glued to the ground will have neither elegance of posture nor flexibility of movement.
Abba Eban     His ignorance is encyclopedic.
Abba Eban     Consensus is what many people say in chorus but do not believe as individuals.
Abba Eban     Men and nations behave wisely once they have exhausted all the other alternatives.
Abba Eban     It is our experience that political leaders do not always mean the opposite of what they say.
Abba Eban     The Jews are the living embodiment of the minority, the constant reminder of what duties societies owe their minorities, whoever they might be.
Abba Eban     Lest Arab governments be tempted out of sheer routine to rush into impulsive rejection, let me suggest that tragedy is not what men suffer but what they miss.

Abdullah Ahmad Badawi     I, talking about my children, of course I wanted them to succeed in life, they have to choose whatever job or occupation that they want, I will not try to influence.
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi     When she was in United States, we maintained contact, we talked to each other on the phone, almost every night. And there was one occasion I tried to fix this video conferencing but somehow it did not come out very well enough so better to talk on the phone.
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi     I always said that you can use the same vehicle although the driver will change, or the same vehicle to go for the race. It's a different driver, this is exactly what's happening to the cabinet.

Abdullah Ahmad Badawi     We have been given a role to play. We have been asked to provide, to give lectures on the role of Islamic development and the way we do it here, so the people who are Muslims there would understand what the role of Islam is.
Abdullah Ibrahim     When time and space and change converge, we find place. We arrive in Place when we resolve things. Place is peace of mind and understanding. Place is knowledge of self. Place is resolution.
Abdullah Ibrahim     They took away time, and they gave us the clock.
Abdullah Ibrahim     People say that slaves were taken from Africa. This is not true: People were taken from Africa, among them healers and priests, and were made into slaves.
Abdullah Ibrahim     The biggest problem in South Africa is that we have a disrupted timeline. Historically, politically, spiritually, economically, in people's minds, in people's heads.

Aberjhani     The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 represented precisely such a hope - that America had learned from its past and acted to secure a better tomorrow.
Aberjhani     The Civil Rights Act of 1964 laid the foundation for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but it also addressed nearly every other aspect of daily life in a would-be free democratic society.
Aberjhani     Mainstream media's representation, or its guerrilla decontextualization, of black men's lives in particular can set the stage for erroneous assumptions capable of damaging an individual or a nation.
Aberjhani     At some point, a flash of sustained clarity reveals the difference between what someone would have you believe is true, and what you know from the depths of your own heart to the peaks of your soul to be true. What happens after that is up to you.
Aberjhani     Varieties of angels, like varieties of love, are many.
Aberjhani     Because Mr. Mandela's early opponents invested so many resources into distorting the true nature of his advocacy, the singular historic moment millions now celebrate could have been tragically lost to guerrilla decontextualization.
Aberjhani     Classic romantic love is an emotional attraction between two individuals in which they may share a heightened awareness of mutual adoration. Erotic love, traditionally, has been described as shared sexual attraction.
Aberjhani     Many people can rightfully claim, as much as anyone can rightfully claim anything, that much of their lives have been spent stumbling through a cloud of cluelessness.
Aberjhani     Minister and writer Barbara Kaufmann has addressed the subject of guerrilla decontextualization on both the 'Voices Compassionate Education' website and on 'Inner Michael', where she offers the kind of insights into the spiritual aspects of Michael Jackson's creative artistry that mainstream media mostly ignores.
Aberjhani     The study of history empowers nations and individuals with an ability to avoid errors of the past and lay foundations for victories in the future.
Aberjhani     Most of the more celebrated names among African-American authors, poets, and artists are known to the world because of their association with specific cultural arts movements.
Aberjhani     Movies can provide tear-inducing or comically-entertaining representations of love, but many agree that its deeper conflicting complexities often seem unfathomable.
Aberjhani     Nelson Mandela did much more than advocate the practice of democracy in South Africa. Working with a constitutional assembly that drew on the ideas and input of regional representatives as well as ordinary citizens, the president worked to draft a constitution that is now universally regarded as the most progressive of any in the world - bar none.
Aberjhani     Valentine's Day itself, like most holidays in the modern era, has been heavily influenced by commercialism that focuses on the appeal of romantic fantasies.
Aberjhani     The political, social, and spiritual impact of the life example set by Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela might be measured in part by the profound and unique gestures made by people in different countries to honor his life upon learning of his death.
Abhishek Bachchan     A birthday is just another day where you go to work and people give you love. Age is just a state of mind, and you are as old as you think you are. You have to count your blessings and be happy.
Abhishek Bachchan     I am a sports enthusiast, and if given an opportunity, I want to be a sportsman, even today. I want to promote the sport that is indigenous to India. Kabaddi is a matter of national pride. Why can't cricket, hockey, football and kabaddi be given equal platforms and co-exist? I believe that can happen.
Abhishek Bachchan     I have no hang-ups in life. I don't care about groups and camps. I have been brought up with certain values and ethics. I have never been egoistic about my stardom and lineage. I don't have any qualms about breaking the ice with my colleagues. I can walk up to any actor and greet him, irrespective of what kind of equation I share with him.
Abhishek Bachchan     I don't think your personal life has anything to do with your professional life. They are separate things. Whatever is happening at home shouldn't be carried to work. Everyone has his/her own journey. Some revel in the fact that they derive that from personal contentment, and others draw it from extreme sorrow.
Abhishek Bachchan     Critics have a job to do. They do not criticise you without reason.
Abhishek Bachchan     Honestly speaking, I don't like my films. When I watch them, I see a lot of scope for improvement, so if I were to see any of my films, like 'Dhoom,' I might say... 'It would have been better if...' or 'had it been...' and this is all about evolving.
Abhishek Bachchan     I'm not a model; hence I don't see the reason to have a six-pack abs. I can pull off a tough and rugged look of a cop in 'Dhoom' series without taking my shirt off. Cops don't have to move around without a shirt to flaunt their machismo. What makes the character of a cop stand out is his attitude and not his six-pack abs.
Abhishek Bachchan     I am happy with all the films I've done. I have not become the victim of an image. I have managed to do different roles, and I am proud of that.
Abhishek Bachchan     Just because I don't show six-pack abs doesn't mean that I don't have them.
Abhishek Bachchan     I don't believe in asking God for anything. If I am worthy, He will give it to me. I think we should earn his blessings; I have never believed in mannats.
Abhishek Bachchan     I think India is very passionate about films. It's almost a second religion back home. Due to that, I think film stars are - are really held in great esteem. Not that we're complaining, but I think with that comes a lot of responsibility.
Abhishek Bachchan     Anybody who has interacted with me will definitely find me to be a chirpy person.
Abhishek Bachchan     In the Indian film industry, especially those of us who are in mainstream cinema, we invariably play a typical hero's role. More often than not, we cater to the public perception. However, there is a latent desire in most actors to do a role where you can go all out and experiment.
Abhishek Bachchan     I am not one of those people who will ever be comfortable mocking or making caricatures of the stereotypes attached to any community.
Abhishek Bachchan     I think every school in the world should have a sports program.
Abhishek Bachchan     Every actor has his own identity. I don't aspire to be Bond. My quest is to do something new, something different.
Abhishek Bachchan     I do films that I like. I have done comedy, romance, everything, and I always like to do it differently from the previous ones.
Abhishek Bachchan     I feel that one of the hardest things in acting is the way you need to switch your emotions.
Abhishek Bachchan     I like working on my birthday, so I always do.
Abhishek Bachchan     I'm an actor, paid to act. I don't bring personal problems to the sets. Dad taught me that.
Abhishek Bachchan     If people are looking forward to my films, then I am happy, and I must be doing something right.
Abhishek Bachchan     My films are of paramount importance to me, the same as my family. That's not going to change. This is a balance I have to strike throughout my life.
Abhishek Bachchan     The trade magazine and all was banned in my house. The first time I read a film magazine was when I was 18.
Abhishek Bachchan     Honestly, I wish I could be a part of all the remakes of my father's films. But on second thought, I wouldn't want to be a part of any. The thought of being compared to him is unnerving. I'd rather do my films than live in the fear of living up to his standards.
Abhishek Bachchan     I still feel that in India we look upon sports as a recreational activity - which it is - but people have to understand that there is a career in sports. It's not just necessary to be a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer, as most of us Indians appear to think that our children should grow up to be.
Abigail Adams     Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and diligence.
Abigail Adams     Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of husbands. Remember all men would be tyrants if they could.
Abigail Adams     Great necessities call out great virtues.
Abigail Adams     If we mean to have heroes, statesmen and philosophers, we should have learned women.
Abigail Adams     We have too many high-sounding words, and too few actions that correspond with them.
Abigail Adams     I've always felt that a person's intelligence is directly reflected by the number of conflicting points of view he can entertain simultaneously on the same topic.
Abigail Adams     A little of what you call frippery is very necessary towards looking like the rest of the world.
Abigail Adams     I am more and more convinced that man is a dangerous creature and that power, whether vested in many or a few, is ever grasping, and like the grave, cries, 'Give, give.'
Abigail Adams     Wisdom and penetration are the fruit of experience, not the lessons of retirement and leisure. Great necessities call out great virtues.
Abigail Adams     If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice, or representation.
Abigail Adams     Well, knowledge is a fine thing, and mother Eve thought so; but she smarted so severely for hers, that most of her daughters have been afraid of it since.
Abigail Adams     If we do not lay out ourselves in the service of mankind whom should we serve?
Abigail Adams     Arbitrary power is like most other things which are very hard, very liable to be broken.
Abigail Adams     I begin to think, that a calm is not desirable in any situation in life. Man was made for action and for bustle too, I believe.
Abraham Cahan     Be modest, humble, simple. Control your anger.
Abraham Cahan     Remember that it is not enough to abstain from lying by word of mouth; for the worst lies are often conveyed by a false look, smile, or act.
Abraham Cahan     Above all, you must fight conceit, envy, and every kind of ill-feeling in your heart.
Abraham Cahan     I was a great dreamer of day dreams.

Abraham Cahan     If you feel that you are good, don't be too proud of it.
Abraham Cahan     If a man is tongue-tied, don't laugh at him, but, rather, feel pity for him, as you would for a man with broken legs.
Abraham Cahan     Only the other world has substance and reality; only good deeds and holy learning have tangible worth.
Abraham Cahan     What is wealth? A dream of fools.
Abraham Cahan     The orthodox Jewish faith practically excludes woman from religious life.
Abraham Cahan     You must never tire fighting Satan.
Abraham Cahan     God, for example, appealed to me as a beardless man wearing a quilted silk cap; holiness was something burning, forbidding, something connected with fire while a day had the form of an oblong box.
Abraham Cahan     If it be true that our people represent a high percentage of mental vigor, the distinction is probably due, in some measure, to the extremely important part which Talmud studies have played in the spiritual life of the race.
Abraham Cahan     The dearest days in one's life are those that seem very far and very near at once.

Abu Abbas     We never had planned to hijack a ship. We never thought of any war plans outside the Palestinian lands. We wished that the program had not failed and then the warriors could have achieved their goals.
Abu Abbas     I do not feel remorse. Everybody makes mistakes in war.
Abu Abbas     When America is chasing you, the whole world is chasing you.
Abu Abbas     The purpose of armed struggle is not simply to kill... its purpose is to reach a political goal.
Abu Abbas     It is true that a large percentage of the Western world hopes that I am imprisoned or dead. But all my people, the Palestinians and the Arabs, wish me long life and freedom.
Abu Bakr     Allah will help him who moves in the way of Allah.
Abu Bakr     Without knowledge action is useless and knowledge without action is futile.

Abu Bakr     Our abode in this world is transitory, our life therein is but a loan, our breaths are numbered and our indolence is manifest.
Abu Bakr     When knowledge is limited - it leads to folly... When knowledge exceeds a certain limit, it leads to exploitation.
Abu Bakr     He who prays five times a day is in the protection of God, and he who is protected by God cannot be harmed by anyone.
Abu Bakr     If an ignorant person is attracted by the things of the world, that is bad. But if a learned person is thus attracted, it is worse.

Ada Cambridge     O what is life, if we must hold it thus as wind-blown sparks hold momentary fire?
Ada Cambridge     Alone! Alone! No beacon, far or near! No chart, no compass, and no anchor stay!
Ada Cambridge     Let Justice, blind and halt and maimed, chastise the rebel spirit surging in my veins, let the Law deal me penalties and pains And make me hideous in my neighbours' eyes.
Ada Cambridge     Have all the hopes of ages come to naught? Is life no more with noble meaning fraught?
Adam Baldwin     I'm like a fungus; you can't get rid of me.
Adam Baldwin     It was never the fame or fortune that drove me to act. It was something I love and enjoy doing it. A lot of people identify who they are by what they do and that's not me. It's what I do but not who I am. Who I am is a parent. I'm a family man.
Adam Baldwin     I just consider myself a piece of the puzzle and I'm lucky enough to be asked or invited to the party, if you will. I hope I can bring some laughs and grimaces to the fans.
Adam Baldwin     I tested for a couple of pilots, but they said I was too tall.
Adam Baldwin     I was involved with drama departments since the 5th grade. I played at it. It was an escape.
Adam Baldwin     I'm not much of a jokester.
Adam Baldwin     My heroes are the camera crew and the electricians. They work such long hours.
Adam Baldwin     You get a sense of how the show works and then let your personality take over.
Adam Baldwin     The only people who have control over their careers are the ones you see on the covers of magazines. Everyone else is just plodding along making a living. The key is not to live over your means and overdo it.
Adam Baldwin     The guys I grew up with, my cinematic heroes, have always been men of few words, but of action. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach.

Adam Baldwin     I think work begets work.
Adam Baldwin     I'm no Leonardo DiCaprio.

Adam Baldwin     What I try to do is to appreciate every job I have while I'm working on it.
Adam Baldwin     A lot of the television industry is so cookie-cutter. In general, there are so many shows that are easy and bland to watch. You can tune in at any time and know exactly where you are in the story arc because it's pretty much the same every week.
Adam Baldwin     I'm always looking, as an actor, for activities. I think it's far more interesting to watch what people do than what they say. You always want to watch behavior, because the dialogue as written by our illustrious leaders is great. Eminently playable.
Adam Davidson     Economics is all about consumption. People either spend money now or they use financial instruments - like bonds, stocks and savings accounts - so they can spend more later.
Adam Davidson     Hating Wall Street is an American tradition that dates back even to the days when Thomas Jefferson cursed that money lover Alexander Hamilton. And for centuries, the complaints about it have largely stayed the same: 'It does nothing! It creates chaos! It's a parasite that sucks hardworking Americans dry!'
Adam Davidson     When you see a merger between two giants in a declining industry, it can look like the financial version of a couple having a baby to save a marriage.
Adam Davidson     Poverty is not the simple result of bad geography, bad culture, bad history. It's the result of us: of the ways that people choose to organize their societies.
Adam Davidson     Holiday binge-buying has deep roots in American culture: department stores have been associating turkey gluttony with its spending equivalent since they began sponsoring Thanksgiving Day parades in the early 20th century.
Adam Davidson     The cardinal rule of taxation is that whatever you put a levy on, you'll inevitably get less of. Taxing corporate activity means less investing, less hiring, fewer jobs and a smaller economy, which hurts the rich, the poor and the middle class alike.
Adam Davidson     If an alien with an accounting degree touched down in America, it might conclude that we're a weird cult that spends 11 months living frugally and four crazy weeks buying tons of stuff we don't need. It wouldn't be entirely wrong, either.
Adam Davidson     'Reinventing the Bazaar,' by John McMillan, is a great and fun introduction to the wild variety and importance of markets throughout history and around the world. I finally understood how a Middle Eastern souk actually works economically and how to compare that to modern-day telecom-spectrum auctions. I love that book.
Adam Davidson     If the American government can't stand behind the dollar, the world's benchmark currency, then the global financial system will very likely enter a new era in which there is much less trade and much less economic growth. It would be, by most accounts, the largest self-imposed financial disaster in history.
Adam Davidson     In poor countries, the rich and powerful crush the poor and powerless.
Adam Davidson     Whenever you hear news about jobless claims or the unemployment rate, you should translate that in your mind to one simple phrase: Stay in school.
Adam Davidson     Economics is not a discipline that comes to correct answers - economies are too complex.
Adam Davidson     Lots of countries have great constitutions, but their leaders have a practice of ignoring the rules whenever they feel like it.
Adam Davidson     The economy works best when better ideas win out over worse ideas, harder work wins out over less work, when it's a fair fight in the marketplace.
Adam Davidson     Unlike physics, economists don't settle things. There seems to be plenty of room for different conclusions that are still accepted in the academy.
Adam Davidson     We can fight over what the taxation levels should be, but the tax system should be very, very simple and not distortionary.
Adam Davidson     When you cover the economy as a reporter, there's one part of the job that is always easy: finding economists who disagree.
Adam Davidson     The America that I think most Americans would want, most economists on the right or left would want, is one in which a smart, ambitious, hardworking person without a huge amount of resources has a pretty good shot, in the end, of beating out a less smart, less ambitious, less hardworking rich person.
Adam Davidson     The American dream always meant that anybody willing to put in a hard day's work could make a decent living. That's just not true anymore for people without at least some post-high school education.
Adam Davidson     The idea of confidence, of the emotions of the population, is an incredibly important one in economics. John Maynard Keynes called it 'animal spirit.' And if people are feeling generally good about the future, they're more likely to spend money, to start new companies; companies are more likely to hire people, make investments.
Adam Davidson     The economics profession advances by one confusing financial disaster at a time.
Adam Davidson     Most rich countries have reported increases in happiness as they become richer.
Adam Davidson     The so-called skills gap is really a gap in education, and that affects all of us.
Adam Davidson     Happiness quantification sounds a bit wishy-washy, sure, and through a series of carefully administered surveys across the globe, economists and psychologists have certainly confronted a fair number of sticky issues around how to measure, and even define, happiness.
Adam Davidson     Art is often valuable precisely because it isn't a sensible way to make money.
Adam Faith     I'd like to be a geneticist to be honest, but there are limits to what I can do now. For my dream to come true I'd have to be 20 years old again, heading off to a blue chip university.
Adam Faith     I'm working harder now than ever before. I couldn't turn down the BBC job because I've never been offered the opportunity of killing three or four people on screen before!
Adam Faith     I had a financial page to write in the Mail on Sunday where I'd give tips on shares. I worked there for two and a half years. Nothing compares to the burst of energy felt on a newsroom floor when a big story breaks.
Adam Ferguson     Every step and every movement of the multitude, even in what are termed enlightened ages, are made with equal blindness to the future; and nations stumble upon establishments, which are indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.
Adam Ferguson     In every commercial state, notwithstanding any pretension to equal rights, the exaltation of a few must depress the many.
Adam Ferguson     Man, in his animal capacity, is qualified to subsist in every climate.
Adam Ferguson     Like the winds that we come we know not whence and blow whither soever they list, the forces of society are derived from an obscure and distant origin. They arise before the date of philosophy, from the instincts, not the speculations of men.
Adam Ferguson     The artist finds, that the more he can confine his attention to a particular part of any work, his productions are the more perfect, and grow under his hands in the greater quantities.
Adam Ferguson     The history of mankind is confined within a limited period, and from every quarter brings an intimation that human affairs have had a beginning.
Adam Garcia     During 'Saturday Night Fever' at the end of the first act dance number I tried to perform a split-jump, only I can't do them so I ended up on my ass followed by the most unsightly backward roll out of it, followed by the cast falling over in laughter and a good portion of the audience too.
Adam Garcia     I love travelling, and had the pleasure of being in the most developed country in the world and then parts of two of the most pristine natural areas of the world: the Galapagos islands and the Equador Amazon jungle. The contrast was incredible.
Adam Garcia     I'm a loser on Sunday. Yeah, I'm a couch potato. I get up and try and eat and then back on the couch. And watch anything.
Adam Garcia     Well it's hard to remember who, but I drunk dial a lot.
Adam Garcia     If I could have anyone on speed dial it would be George Clooney. He seems like a cool guy who would give good advice.
Adam Garcia     People do more important jobs than acting in film that should be recognised, but for some reason it's big money, so people are elevated in status. If I was a bus driver, I'm sure you wouldn't be interviewing me.
Adam Garcia     I was seeing this girl recently and used to call her up saying I missed her. I can't help it after a few drinks!
Adam Garcia     The most famous person in my phone is Lindsay Lohan. We starred in 'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' together in 2004 and we've stayed in touch.
Adam Garcia     At 15 I auditioned for 42nd Street in Australia. Dein Perry was in that show. I actually got the job but I couldn't do it because I was only 15. Legally I needed to have another 15-year-old to cover consecutive nights.
Adam Garcia     My favorite thing to do is to wind those guys up by hitting on their girlfriends. I say, 'I think your girlfriend's gorgeous, but it's all right, I'm gay.' They get very nervous after a few minutes!
Adam Garcia     I think 'Tap Dogs' has lasted so long because people have a natural interest in tap dancing. This form of dancing can't be dated, it's such an intriguing form of dance because the feet are also an an instrument.
Adam Garcia     Families, particularly, tend to be the ones that you take the most for granted. They seem to slip under the radar, all those important things - it almost becomes second nature to do so.
Adam Garcia     You eventually get used to looking at girls picking their leotards out of their bums and that sort of stuff.
Adam Garcia     I do like to keep mementos from my work, whether they be photos, the backs of make-up chairs or even props and clothes.
Adam Garcia     I don't care if people think I'm gay. I know I'm not, so it doesn't bother me.
Adam Garcia     I love 'Glee' so much. It just works - it's on the edge of ridiculous.
Adam Garcia     I started tapping and I was okay. Then after about two years my feet knew what they were doing!
Adam Garcia     I started with ballet and then my cousin Sarah introduced me to her tap teachers.
Adam Garcia     It's always fun teasing the person. When they ask if I'm gay, I say, 'Oh, I don't know.'
Adam Garcia     The process of rehearsal means you learn so much and really get the chance to develop your work on a character.
Adam Garcia     They spend an awful lot of money on I-don't-know-what in Hollywood movies; I certainly didn't get any of it. But they sure do love spending money.
Adam Garcia     They think my life is glamourous. It's not true. I obviously get to come in and do radio interviews. That's the glamour. But other than that, I eat and sleep and that's it. Eat, sleep and do shows.
Adam Hamilton     God seeks to influence humanity. This is at the heart of the Christmas story. It is the story of light coming into the darkness, of a Savior to show us the way, of light overcoming the darkness, of God's work to save the world.
Adam Hamilton     As a pastor, I have a deep desire to lead people to God and encourage people to pray, read the Bible, and carry their faith into every part of their lives.
Adam Hamilton     Jesus' own witness of sacrificial love and forgiveness, and his work to heal the sick and care for those in need, represent God's ways and vision for us.
Adam Hamilton     While some misuse their freedom to perpetrate evil, millions respond by feeling compelled to use their freedom to do good.
Adam Hamilton     I am a pastor, and I teach and preach the Bible to my congregation every week. But the Bible is not a manufacturer's handbook. Neither is it a science textbook nor a guidebook for public policy.
Adam Hamilton     The Bible calls us to love our neighbors, and to do justice and love kindness, not to indiscriminately kill one another.
Adam Hamilton     I love the Bible. I read it every day. I spend 10 hours a week studying it. It has affected my life in profound ways. I am inspired when I read it.
Adam Hamilton     If 'everything happens for a reason,' then every act of evil is ultimately God's doing.
Adam Hamilton     Christians believe that God is everywhere and is involved in our lives at every moment, whether we publicly acknowledge God or not.
Adam Hamilton     I'm convinced many of America's heroes are public school teachers and administrators. Many of these people do what they do because of their faith.
Adam Hamilton     In America our public schools are intended to be religiously neutral. Our teachers and schools are neither to endorse nor to inhibit religion. I believe this is a very good thing.
Adam Hamilton     Learning to read the Bible in the light of the times in which it was written is critical.
Adan Canto     I've always been fascinated by people, their psychology, what drives them and trying to understand them.
Adan Canto     I kind of stumbled into acting, even though I've always been fascinated by people and kind of their motives, and it's been amazing to me, everything I read before about psychology, philosophy, just to put it into practice somehow.
Adan Canto     In theater, you go in-depth with your character, so coming to the States, it was inevitable to dig into the pilots I liked. I knew what characters I was going to be reading for, so I would dissect them and really get involved with them.
Adan Canto     I never said that I wanted to be an actor when I was a kid. I didn't know. I thought I was going to be a singer and musician. That's what I had been doing, for a huge part of my life.
Adan Canto     Music, in Mexico, just wasn't working out. So, I fell into acting and I just fell in love with it. It was amazing! It was a great safe place to just vent.
Adan Canto     I'm a runner. Not a race runner, but I just love to run, and I don't think I've ever tasted such amazing food like I've tasted in the whole entire New York.
Adele     I like looking nice, but I always put comfort over fashion. I don't find thin girls attractive; be happy and healthy. I've never had a problem with the way I look. I'd rather have lunch with my friends than go to a gym.
Adele     Mum loves me being famous! She is so excited and proud, as she had me so young and couldn't support me, so I am living her dream, it's sweeter for both of us. It's her 40th birthday soon and I'm going to buy her 40 presents.
Adele     It's never been an issue for me - I don't want to go on a diet, I don't want to eat a Caesar salad with no dressing, why would I do that? I ain't got time for this, just be happy and don't be stupid. If I've got a boyfriend and he loves my body then I'm not worried.
Adele     I don't make music for eyes. I make music for ears.
Adele     I have insecurities of course, but I don't hang out with anyone who points them out to me.
Adele     I've been singing properly every day since I was about fifteen or sixteen, and I have never had any problems with my voice, ever. I've had a sore throat here and there, had a cold and sung through it, but that day it just went while I was onstage in Paris during a radio show. It was literally like someone had pulled a curtain over it.
Adele     My voice went recently, never happened before, off like a tap. I had to sit in silence for nine days, chalkboard around my neck. Like an old-school mime. Like a kid in the naughty corner. Like a Victorian mute.
Adele     Heartbreak can definitely give you a deeper sensibility for writing songs. I drew on a lot of heartbreak when I was writing my first album, I didn't mean to but I just did.
Adele     I will not do festivals. The thought of an audience that big frightens the life out of me.
Adele     My life is full of drama, and I don't have time to worry about something as petty as what I look like.
Adele     I just want to make music, I don't want people to talk about me. All I've ever wanted to do was sing. I don't want to be a celebrity. I don't want to be in people's faces, you know, constantly on covers of magazine that I haven't even known I'm on.
Adele     I don't write songs about a specific, elusive thing. I write about love, and everyone knows what it is like to have your heart broken.
Adele     Sometimes with pop music, you have to see it to love it. With soul music, it's sparse. There's nothing that's pretentious or planned. It's just so gutsy.
Adele     I'm really happy to be me, and I'd like to think people like me more because I'm happy with myself and not because I refuse to conform to anything.
Adele     I like having my hair and face done, but I'm not going to lose weight because someone tells me to. I make music to be a musician not to be on the cover of Playboy.
Adele     The focus on my appearance has really surprised me. I've always been a size 14 to 16, I don't care about clothes, I'd rather spend my money on cigarettes and booze.
Adele     I love a card. You know, cards? At birthdays? I collect them.
Adele     I have never been insecure, ever, about how I look, about what I want to do with myself. My mum told me to only ever do things for myself, not for others.
Adele     I've never been more normal than I am now.
Adele     I've never wanted to look like models on the cover of magazines. I represent the majority of women and I'm very proud of that.
Adele     I am never writing a breakup record again, by the way. I'm done with being a bitter witch.
Adele     I am quite loud and bolshie. I'm a big personality. I walk into a room, big and tall and loud.
Adele     You have to prioritize what you stress about when you have a child.
Adele     Crying is really bad for your vocal cords.
Adele     I don't really need to stand out, there's room for everyone. Although I haven't built a niche yet, I'm just writing love songs.
Adolf Eichmann     I was one of the many horses pulling the wagon and couldn't escape left or right because of the will of the driver.
Adolf Eichmann     Now that I look back, I realize that a life predicated on being obedient and taking orders is a very comfortable life indeed. Living in such a way reduces to a minimum one's need to think.
Adolf Eichmann     To sum it all up, I must say that I regret nothing.
Adolf Eichmann     We shall meet again. I have believed in God. I obeyed the laws of war and was loyal to my flag.
Adolf Galland     It's unbelievable what one squadron of twelve aircraft did to tip the balance.
Adolf Galland     According to Goering and the Luftwaffe High Command, they were supposed to be the fighter elite.
Adolf Galland     I would like to mention that I have flown the 262 first in May '43. At this time, the aircraft was completely secret. I first knew of the existence of this aircraft only early in '42 - even in my position. This aircraft didn't have any priority in design or production.
Adolf Galland     If we would have had the 262 at our disposal - even with all the delays - if we could have had in '44, ah, let's say three hundred operational, that day we could have stopped the American daytime bombing offensive, that's for sure.
Adolf Galland     Many pilots of the time were the opinion that a fighter pilot in a closed cockpit was an impossible thing, because you should smell the enemy. You could smell them because of the oil they were burning.
Adolf Galland     When I was fired from my post as General of the Fighter Arm, I was to give proof that this jet was a superior fighter. And that's when we did it. I think we did it.
Adolf Galland     And most of these pilots were lost during the first five flights.
Adolf Galland     I could not claim them because I was not supposed to be flying in combat.
Adolf Galland     I had to inspect all fighter units in Russia, Africa, Sicily, France, and Norway. I had to be everywhere.
Adolf Galland     I made a written report which is still today in existence. I have a photocopy of it, and I am saying that in production this aircraft could perhaps substitute for three propeller- driven aircraft of the best existing type. This was my impression.
Adolf Galland     Of course, the outcome of the war would not have been changed. The war was lost perhaps, when it was started. At least it was lost in the winter of '42, in Russia.
Adolf Galland     We had at our disposal the first operational jet, which superseded by at least 150 knots the fastest American and English fighters. This was a unique situation.
Adolf Galland     We have built a total of about 1250 of this aircraft, but only fifty were allowed to be used as fighters - as interceptors. And out of this fifty, there were never more than 25 operational. So we had only a very, very few.
Adolf Galland     Nine g's is good, if the pilot can stand it. We couldn't stand it. Not in the airplanes of World War II.
Adolf Galland     This would only come if you have a revolutionary change in technology like the jet brought about.
Adolf Galland     The throttles could only move very, very slowly, always watching the temperature, always watching. And even in throttling back, you could bust it, even being very careful.
Adrian Edmondson     We had so much fun in Ghana and they are really lovely people.
Adrian Edmondson     On stage, we just want to generate hysteria. We don't care about looking cool or posing.
Adrian Edmondson     A lot of people are obsessed with looking cool. They feel they have to look after their image.
Adrian Edmondson     Performers like Tommy Cooper, who are always getting things wrong, are much more endearing than comedians who are sassy and smart.
Adrian Edmondson     I've always had a kind of visual eye, and it was a pleasant exercise for that.
Adrian Edmondson     There is a lot of rubbish written about toilet humour - people saying it is childish and pretending it is beneath them - but there is no doubting the effectiveness of a really good willy gag.
Adrian Edmondson     From the stage I've seen people of all ages absolutely roaring at really good toilet humour.
Adrian Edmondson     I'm waiting for the time when I fail - because we all fail - and I'm ready, I'll take up carpentry.
Adrian Edmondson     I've never played a hero before so I jumped at the chance.
Adrian Edmondson     Richie and Eddie couldn't exist without each other. They're two halves of the same person.
Adrian Edmondson     I don't claim that our TV comedies are highbrow in anyway, but I think there's a basis to them, and that's why they're more popular than other TV comedies. There's a basis of truth in them, a gut feeling.
Adrian Edmondson     We only have one agenda, which is to make 'em laugh their pants off. Unless they are girls, of course, when it is to make them laugh their bras off so we can get a quick look.
Adrian Edmondson     It only works because we still amuse each other. After we have been working with other people, it is so refreshing to laugh unreservedly when we are back together again.
Adrian Edmondson     Even though we work in the same field, we have an intense private life away from our professional lives.
Adrian Edmondson     Most modern comedy is crap.
Adrian Edmondson     The most fun I ever have is sitting in with Rick writing, and we laugh at our own jokes.
Adrian Edmondson     We have never been strictly political, only strictly funny.
Adrian Edmondson     You're entering dangerous land when you start theorising about comedy.
Adrian Edmondson     People expect us to be different, but we're not. We're very similar people, and it's because we're so similar and close to each other that we make each other laugh - in fact we make each other laugh more than we make anyone else laugh.
Adrian Edmondson     I remember once having to stop performing when I thought an elderly man a few rows back from the front was actually going to die because he was laughing so hard.
Adrian Edmondson     It's definitely time to stop. We're getting too old. We both realised that the show wasn't as engaging as it used to be. We were starting to look a bit ridiculous.
Adrienne Bailon     Autism doesn't have to define a person. Artists with autism are like anyone else: They define themselves through hard work and individuality.
Adrienne Bailon     Don't ever give up. Believe in yourself or no one else will. My personal saying is: 'I'd rather die knowing that I tried to do what I love.'
Adrienne Bailon     When I was 19 years old, I actually did get breast implants. Probably one of my greatest regrets because I went from having an insecurity that I didn't have big breasts to now looking like a porn star, and I was like, 'This is not great.'
Adrienne Bailon     Autism currently affects one in 88 children in the U.S., and its prevalence continues to rise. That's why it's important to help organizations like Autism Speaks raise awareness and funds to support families and individuals impacted by it.
Adrienne Bailon     When my hair is curly, I use Suave coconut conditioner. It's not a leave-in, but I use it like one. It is so light and really brings out my hair's curl. A lot of leave-ins are too heavy, but this one is just perfect. When it's straight, I love Frederick Fekkai Tech Shampoo & Conditioner and their Olive Oil glossing cream.
Adrienne Bailon     A friend of mine works for Autism Speaks. It's an amazing cause that is making a real difference in the lives of so many people.
Adrienne Bailon     Do you know how many times my career has been close to rock bottom? Each time, I was like, 'Girl, figure it out. Reinvent yourself.'
Adrienne Bailon     I am personally am a fan of buff nails - not so much of clear polish, but a great buff nail is amazing.
Adrienne Bailon     I don't love duck nails, where the nails are really wide on top. I am not a fan of that!
Adrienne Bailon     I see my sister, and she's on her second baby, and I'm like, 'That's success.' Having a family - I can't wait for that.
Adrienne Bailon     I think for such a long time people had this misconception of who I was and what I was about.
Adrienne Bailon     I think the most important thing that I've learned is that you live and you learn. Try not to make the same mistakes twice.
Adrienne Bailon     I want a family. I see my sister, and she's on her second baby, and I'm like, 'That's success.' Having a family - I can't wait for that.
Adrienne Bailon     I'm huge fan of 'Timeflies.'
Adrienne Bailon     One of my goals is to have this incredible body. I want to be strong, to be ripped.
Adrienne Bailon     Understand that life is journey. I haven't achieved the success I wanted to achieve yet, but that's OK - it's coming.
Adrienne Bailon     Do you know how many times my career has been close to rock bottom? Each time, I was like, 'Girl, figure it out. Reinvent yourself.' Just the other day, I was having lunch with my mom, and she said, 'You've taught me so much. You are so resilient.'
Adrienne Bailon     Getting your nails done with your man is so much fun. Having them help you out choosing the color, I love that. I think it's great to get a man's perspective on nails and to sit there to get your nails done with him.
Adrienne Bailon     I feel like in L.A., you wake up, you put your diamond studs on, put your workout gear, your cute shades, and it is kind of the outfit you stay in the entire day.
Adrienne Bailon     I have an odd fetish with nails. I was always doing beauty blogs about nails, and it would be on Fridays called 'Friday's Fingertip Fetish.' It became so popular that a nail polish company approached me, and Fingertip Fetish was born.
Adrienne Bailon     I honestly really, really love Topshop. I've bought a lot of booties from there. I think they have a great selection of really funky booties at Topshop.
Adrienne Bailon     I honestly really, really love Topshop. I've bought a lot of booties from there. I think they have a great selection of really funky booties at Topshop. My splurge would be a pair of leather Christian Louboutin over-the-knee boots. They're sick! I would do a really stretchy skinny jean under a black turtleneck and call it a day!
Adrienne Bailon     I think The 'Cheetah Girls' was originally supposed to be one film, but then it became two and three, which was a huge deal. But like all Disney franchises, they have to come to an end at some point. I was so grateful we went out with a bang. I think we died off peacefully.
Adrienne Bailon     One of my favorite fall items is a turtleneck. Cozy pieces like that for the fall - cashmere, fluffy cream turtlenecks - I think that's so sexy.
Adrienne Bailon     I think I'm a pretty open book. We're all a work in progress, and I'm not ashamed to say that I don't have it all together - I don't really think anyone does.
Aeschines     For then only will you be strong, when you cherish the laws, and when the revolutionary attempts of lawless men shall have ceased.
Aeschines     Be assured, fellow citizens, that in a democracy it is the laws that guard the person of the citizen and the constitution of the state, whereas the despot and the oligarch find their protection in suspicion and in armed guards.
Aeschylus     From a small seed a mighty trunk may grow.
Aeschylus     He who learns must suffer. And even in our sleep pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.

Aeschylus     God lends a helping hand to the man who tries hard.
Aeschylus     I have learned to hate all traitors, and there is no disease that I spit on more than treachery.

Aeschylus     And one who is just of his own free will shall not lack for happiness; and he will never come to utter ruin.
Aeschylus     What atonement is there for blood spilt upon the earth?

Aeschylus     For know that no one is free, except Zeus.
Aeschylus     I know how men in exile feed on dreams.

Afrika Bambaataa     The Universal Zulu Nation stands to acknowledge wisdom, understanding, freedom, justice, and equality, peace, unity, love, and having fun, work, overcoming the negative through the positive, science, mathematics, faith, facts, and the wonders of God, whether we call him Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, or Jah.
Afrika Bambaataa     The only thing I want is to awaken all humans on the planet that we are living on Mother Earth.
Afrika Bambaataa     You want to buy cars and houses and castles, all of that's on you and how America has systematized your mind to be into materialism. Hip-hop ain't got nothing to do with that. I'm glad that anybody making money has picked themselves up - I just want them to give some of it back to the community.
Afrika Bambaataa     November is Hip-Hop History Month, where we give celebration to what hip hop has done to bring together people of the world, people of all nationalities, young people, all the political systems and politicians on the planet.
Afrika Bambaataa     We want you to sit down and leave your egos at home and let's get an understanding as to where all this is foolishness coming from. There are others who are putting things out there or throwing a stick and hiding their hand and keeping things built up in the media.
Afrika Bambaataa     A lot of times, when people say hip-hop, they don't know what they're talking about. They just think of the rappers. When you talk about hip-hop, you're talking about the whole culture and movement. You have to take the whole culture for what it is.
Afrika Bambaataa     Everybody needs to show respect to each others' ways and the cultural life that you get on this planet. Don't get caught up on 'I'm brown, black, white, red, blue, whatever.' You gotta ask, what were you called before 1492? All these names we're using now are just an illusion made to keep us fighting each other.
Afrika Bambaataa     All music is dance music. But when people think of dance music, they think of techno or just house. Anything you can dance to is dance music. I don't care if it's classical, funk, salsa, reggae, calypso; it's all dance music.
Afrika Bambaataa     You treat people with greatness and greatness will come back to you.
Afrika Bambaataa     How you act, walk, look and talk is all part of Hip Hop culture. And the music is colorless. Hip Hop music is made from Black, brown, yellow, red and white.
Afrika Bambaataa     It ain't no joke when you lose your vinyl.
Afrika Bambaataa     My definition of hip hop is taking elements from many other spheres of music to make hip hop. Whether it be breakbeat, whether it be the groove and grunt of James Brown or the pickle-pop sounds of Kraftwerk or Yellow Magic Orchestra, hip hop is also part of what they call hip-house now, or trip hop, or even parts of drum n' bass.
Afrika Bambaataa     I'm as old as the moon and the stars, and as young as the trees and the lakes. My style comes from looking at what came before me, and from visiting a lot of places.
Afrika Bambaataa     They allow us to disrespect our Black woman. A lot of these things would be considered criminal if it were to be carried out in the streets. That's like when they tell you after you buy your VHS and you rent movies they tell you not to copy the movies.
Afrika Bambaataa     I am one of the founders of Hip-Hop along with my brothers Kool DJ Herc and Grandmaster Flash.
Afrika Bambaataa     I'm the renegade of funk. I've made house, techno, rock, funk, reggae... That's why I've been on so many different labels.
Afrika Bambaataa     I wear anything of culture, from the Earth or beyond. The whole planet is my shop.
Afrika Bambaataa     There's a lot of people over time who have brought out all these funky records that everybody has started jumping on like a catch phrase... When Planet Rock came out, then you had all of the electro funk records.
Afrika Bambaataa     Hip-hop has been hijacked by a Luciferian conspiracy. People have used hip-hop in a lot of ways that cause a lot of mind problems. They use the word wrongfully. They use it to mean a part instead of a whole.
Afrika Bambaataa     I'm fanatical about movies: African, European, Viking, Roman. I got into witchcraft and magic from watching 'Bewitched' and 'The Wizard of Oz,' which shows in some of my outfits. I dress to reflect the whole spectrum of the universe.
Afrika Bambaataa     If you see something is going wrong within politics and the world today, then some Hip Hop artist is gonna come along and get straight with it. If they think that there's a lot of racism going on then there's another Hip Hop artist who's gonna come out and speak their mind.
Afrika Bambaataa     We used to play a lot of Fela Kuti in the early days of hip-hop. In my DJ sets I'll jump off into rock, salsa, African. I like to play some crazy stuff and see the vibrations of the people.
Afrika Bambaataa     We also want to try and slow down all this foolishness that's going on between the East and West. We gotta understand that Hip Hop is now universal. Hip Hop is not East coast or West coast.
Afrika Bambaataa     When you talk about rap you have to understand that rap is part of the Hip-Hop culture.
Afrika Bambaataa     Actually freestyle really comes from 'Planet Rock'. If you listen to all the freestyle records you'll hear that they are based on 'Planet Rock'. All the Miami Bass records are based upon Planet Rock.
Afrojack     People need realness, reality. People can sense when someone is being pretentious or fake. It's because you feel it; you see it in someone's body language.
Afrojack     For me, it's a great thing to tell people anything is possible. When I was 15, people told me 'You're not going to be a DJ.'
Afrojack     Maybe one day there will finally be an education for electronic music.
Afrojack     One of the reasons why my album is called 'Forget the World' is because when you listen to the world, you make stupid mistakes.
Afrojack     I have been fully involved in designing my stage shows; it's important to me to do something really unique and almost off-the-wall to bring the music and the visuals together. I love design and actually went to school for a bit for graphic design, so it isn't so much 'pressure' for me; it's a way to be creative, and I really enjoy it.
Afrojack     I was in school - I was a good learner; if I wanted to get something done, I could get it done. I was lazy, though. I was always, like, sort of an outcast. And when I got home, I was always doing music, but when I was doing music, no one was there to judge it, you know? It was just me in my bedroom. It gave me freedom and made me happy.
Afrojack     My debut album, 'Forget the World,' is all about not listening to the negativity around you and to continue to do what you love, no matter what people think. I love what I do. Dance music is my passion, my life. There is no greater feeling than being one with my fans, partying to the music we love.
Afrojack     People buy a ticket to see your show, so from the moment I get onstage, I can have no insecurities, because they're already there. You have to get people to listen. If they listen, everything's cool.
Afrojack     Cars for me are like a piece of art.
Afrojack     Every song, every form of art, clothing, shoes, it has to be special.
Afrojack     Holland is to dance music what Nashville is to country.
Afrojack     I actually did a remix for Katy Perry, and her management didn't respond.
Afrojack     I always loved cars. I used to play 'Need for Speed' all the time... any racing game.
Afrojack     I even have shoes that don't fit. They're just so cool, I wanted to have them.
Afrojack     I have a living room full of clothes. It's insane.
Afrojack     I want to make an album my grandma and my fans are going to like. I want to make my grandma understand a drop and make club fans understand a song.
Afrojack     I'm a DJ who makes dance music who got to play with Sting.
Afrojack     I'm a DJ, but I'm also a ridiculously high-grossing musician due to doing productions.
Afrojack     I'm a producer for fun. I'm not a professional schooled musician or anything.
Afrojack     If you really want a radio station to play your song, go to that radio station every day with that song in your hand and say, 'Please play it.'
Afrojack     Most music that comes out of Holland is basically the harder part of dance music - hip-hop, drum'n'bass.
Afrojack     The coolest things in life are things that you have not done before. That's the key to life: new things always.
Afrojack     The only person you need to be credible to is yourself. When you stand in front of the mirror and nobody is watching, are you happy with yourself?
Afrojack     The only thing you can do to lead a crowd is prove your passion to them.
Afrojack     The only way you can be happy is if you be completely yourself. You have to be you. Don't be what you think you should be.
Agatha Christie     One of the luckiest things that can happen to you in life is, I think, to have a happy childhood.
Agatha Christie     Very few of us are what we seem.
Agatha Christie     One doesn't recognize the really important moments in one's life until it's too late.
Agatha Christie     I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow, but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.
Agatha Christie     Too much mercy... often resulted in further crimes which were fatal to innocent victims who need not have been victims if justice had been put first and mercy second.
Agatha Christie     Good advice is always certain to be ignored, but that's no reason not to give it.
Agatha Christie     Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.
Agatha Christie     An archaeologist is the best husband a woman can have. The older she gets the more interested he is in her.
Agatha Christie     I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow, but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.
Agatha Christie     I don't think necessity is the mother of invention. Invention, in my opinion, arises directly from idleness, possibly also from laziness - to save oneself trouble.
Agatha Christie     Everything that has existed, lingers in the Eternity.
Agatha Christie     Dogs are wise. They crawl away into a quiet corner and lick their wounds and do not rejoin the world until they are whole once more.
Agatha Christie     Any woman can fool a man if she wants to and if he's in love with her.
Agatha Christie     It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them.
Agatha Christie     The best time to plan a book is while you're doing the dishes.
Agatha Christie     Most successes are unhappy. That's why they are successes - they have to reassure themselves about themselves by achieving something that the world will notice.
Agatha Christie     Where large sums of money are concerned, it is advisable to trust nobody.
Agatha Christie     But surely for everything you have to love you have to pay some price.
Agatha Christie     There's too much tendency to attribute to God the evils that man does of his own free will.
Agatha Christie     If one sticks too rigidly to one's principles, one would hardly see anybody.
Agatha Christie     Never do anything yourself that others can do for you.
Agatha Christie     It is ridiculous to set a detective story in New York City. New York City is itself a detective story.
Agatha Christie     There is nothing more thrilling in this world, I think, than having a child that is yours, and yet is mysteriously a stranger.
Agatha Christie     The popular idea that a child forgets easily is not an accurate one. Many people go right through life in the grip of an idea which has been impressed on them in very tender years.
Agatha Christie     The happy people are failures because they are on such good terms with themselves they don't give a damn.
Agnetha Faltskog     My path has not been determined. I shall have more experiences and pass many more milestones.
Agnetha Faltskog     There is a danger of changing too much in the search for perfection.
Agnetha Faltskog     I can spot empty flattery and know exactly where I stand. In the end it's really only my own approval or disapproval that means anything.
Agnetha Faltskog     It's strange that the newspapers don't see a connection between their false revelations about my private life and my need for seclusion and security.
Agnetha Faltskog     I just want to live in peace and quiet.
Agnetha Faltskog     I have always had strong maternal instincts. Even when I was still a child I cut out pictures of prams from newspapers and imagined the feeling of pushing my own pram through fresh winter snow and seeing the wheels' tracks behind me in the snow.
Agnetha Faltskog     It has always felt like a failure that Bjorn and I couldn't keep our family together. You never get it back, but to this day I don't regret splitting up. The reason behind our separation is one of those things I definitely don't want to go into!
Agnetha Faltskog     I must be allowed to be as I am.
Agnetha Faltskog     I would like to sing the theme tune of a big film - something like 'Titanic.'
Agnetha Faltskog     There was a time when the music fell silent. Both within me and around me.
Agnetha Faltskog     When I was 25, Abba was formed. After Abba I made three solo albums. Maybe I have been productive enough.
Agnetha Faltskog     I have one pug and one Czechoslovakian dog called Prazsky krysarik.
Agnetha Faltskog     My life contains so many other things; I have my children, my grandchildren, my two dogs and a big place in the country. I have my own life.
Agnetha Faltskog     The press has always written that I am a recluse and a mysterious woman, but I am more down-to-earth than they think.
Agnetha Faltskog     When I'm living in the world of luxury and celebrity, which is where I found myself for a large part of my life, it's a walk-on part. Not a vital necessity, like it is for so many people. I enjoy it but I can see right through it!
Agnetha Faltskog     No one who has experienced facing a screaming, boiling, hysterical audience can avoid feeling shivers in the spine. It's a thin line between celebration and menace.
Agnetha Faltskog     I may have aimed too high sometimes, asked too much of myself and demanded too little from those around me.
Agnetha Faltskog     This idea of trying to repeat a success doesn't interest me. It's only really done to make money.
Agnetha Faltskog     When I was 15 I became a full-time singer in a band. At 18 I made my first record.
Agnetha Faltskog     I sing just for fun.
Agnetha Faltskog     I'm a country bumpkin. I'm not a showgirl.
Agnetha Faltskog     When you love someone, and you've lost that one, then nothing really matters.
Agnetha Faltskog     I am uninterested in appearing in newspapers and on television. Many people think I am striking a pose - that I want to create a sense of shyness. But it's just not something I want to do. I overdosed.
Agnetha Faltskog     I spend a lot of time with the grandchildren. They love it when we sing together. It's fantastic to hear them, and they really can sing. I don't talk to them so much about 'Abba' and the past, but as they get older, they will become more aware.
Agnetha Faltskog     I used to suffer from stage fright, which at times was an ordeal. I won't perform live again. I'm going to do some TV shows and videos but nothing else... I don't like to travel too much or do concerts. I'm more of a studio and home girl.
Ahmad Jamal     I would like to be a scholar in whatever I do, a scholar is never finished, he is always seeking and I am always seeking.
Ahmad Jamal     The quickest way to become troubled is to be concerned with what people are gonna say about your life and your work.
Ahmad Jamal     Many fail to realize this great recording industry was built by so-called jazz artists. And at the other end of the spectrum, a base in European classical music as well.
Ahmad Jamal     You've got a big, big problem if you get caught up in what people say. If you're gonna live for what people say, you might as well lay down and forget it. Because it doesn't work that way.
Aimee Garcia     It's so exciting to headline a film. It's not every day you see a Latina carrying a full-length feature.
Aimee Garcia     Latinos are the fastest growing minority, and we're obviously not going anywhere. We're extremely loyal as a people, and I think Hollywood is starting to recognize that. It's very rare for a major studio to nationally distribute a film with Latino talent, not only in front of the camera, but also behind the camera.
Aimee Garcia     I felt completely at home in Mexico - speaking Spanish to my cousins, running around Acapulco and stuffing my face with mole and homemade tortillas. Mexico opened my heart.
Aimee Garcia     In 'George Lopez', I played Veronica who's a bratty 18-year-old, and so I feel like it's much easier for me to play that because I feel like a late bloomer. It wasn't difficult or challenging at all because it's not like I haven't been a teenager.
Aimee Garcia     I'm dating a very high-maintenance career.
Aimee Garcia     I have been a fan of Dexter since the pilot. Once I got the audition I just squealed, and you would have thought I just won 45 million dollars.
Aimee Garcia     When I was a kid, it wasn't very often that I could go to the movies and see an entire movie carried on the shoulders of someone who looked like me.
Aimee Garcia     Education equals choices. I have been blessed with the choice to be anything I ever wanted to be, and I truly owe my happiness to my family and education.
Aimee Garcia     I always promised myself if I ever got the chance to do a 'Flashdance'-type of movie, I would do my own dancing. I can say with pride that every single dance move in 'Go For It!' is my own dance move.
Aimee Garcia     To me, acting is like tennis. You're only as good as the person you're playing with, so if you're playing with Michael C. Hall, what do you have to worry about?
Al Capone     Capitalism is the legitimate racket of the ruling class.
Al Capone     I am like any other man. All I do is supply a demand.
Al Capone     I don't even know what street Canada is on.
Al Capone     I have built my organization upon fear.
Al Capone     My rackets are run on strictly American lines and they're going to stay that way.
Al Capone     Now I know why tigers eat their young.
Al Capone     Prohibition has made nothing but trouble.
Al Capone     This American system of ours, call it Americanism, call it capitalism, call it what you will, gives each and every one of us a great opportunity if we only seize it with both hands and make the most of it.
Al Capone     Vote early and vote often.
Al Capone     When I sell liquor, it's called bootlegging; when my patrons serve it on Lake Shore Drive, it's called hospitality.
Al Capone     You can get much farther with a kind word and a gun than you can with a kind word alone.
Al Capp     Anyone who can walk to the welfare office can walk to work.
Al Capp     Success is following the pattern of life one enjoys most.
Al Capp     Abstract art: a product of the untalented sold by the unprincipled to the utterly bewildered.
Al Capp     The secret of how to live without resentment or embarrassment in a world in which I was different from everyone else. was to be indifferent to that difference.
Al Capp     The public is like a piano. You just have to know what keys to poke.
Al Capp     Today's younger generation is no worse than my own. We were just as ignorant and repulsive as they are, but nobody listened to us.
Al Capp     Young people should be helped, sheltered, ignored, and clubbed if necessary.
Al Capp     There are certain books in the world which every searcher for truth must know: the Bible, the Critique of Pure Reason, the Origin of Species, and Karl Marx's Capital.
Al Capp     Like all New York hotel lady cashiers she had red hair and had been disappointed in her first husband.
Al Capp     My work is being destroyed almost as soon as it is printed. One day it is being read; the next day someone's wrapping fish in it.
Al Capp     Any place that anyone can learn something useful from someone with experience is an educational institution.
Al D'Amato     We've got to win this battle, and we will. We have to win the peace.
Al D'Amato     As an Italian-American, I have a special responsibility to be sensitive to ethnic stereotypes.
Al D'Amato     Those allies who failed to join us will regret it. They're making a mistake.
Al D'Amato     No. 1, Halliburton. Certainly, if they've overcharged they should be whacked and whacked good, but the idea that the vice president somehow is involved in this, whether they got contracts because of him, that's nonsense.
Al D'Amato     The fact is that the economy is really posed for the kind of recovery that people can see and understand.
Al D'Amato     Now the fact that terrorists throughout the world see this as an opportunity to defeat the United States, we have to be - and every Democratic candidate, even those who opposed us going in, now say we just simply can't cut and run.
Al D'Amato     You have to go to where you can make money, and you see in the service area, in the technological area, those are the areas where we're going to create jobs.
Alain Badiou     Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity. Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle of savage, destructive nihilism.
Alain Badiou     There is a kind of serenity in love which is almost a paradise.
Alain Badiou     A Truth is the subjective development of that which is at once both new and universal. New: that which is unforeseen by the order of creation. Universal: that which can interest, rightly, every human individual, according to his pure humanity.
Alain Badiou     Evil is the interruption of a truth by the pressure of particular or individual interests.
Alain Badiou     Everybody says love is about finding the person who is right for me and then everything will be fine. But it's not like that. It involves work. An old man tells you this!
Alain Badiou     The declaration of love marks the transition from chance to destiny, and that's why it is so perilous and so burdened with a kind of horrifying stage fright.
Alain Badiou     Evil is the moment when I lack the strength to be true to the Good that compels me.
Alain Badiou     I feel really assured by the fact that the women I have loved I have loved for always.
Alan Ball     In my own life, I think legends of supernatural, mythic things are really just a manifestation of the collective unconscious. So I don't really get freaked out. I mean certainly, you read about things people did to each other in the pursuit of some mystical or occult goal, and it's horrifying. But that's just human nature.
Alan Ball     I was conveniently bisexual for a long time, and then I went, 'Come on, who am I kidding?' And I have to say, it was the single biggest step I took toward emotional well-being, to stop feeling like I had to hide who I am.
Alan Ball     It's easy to look at the vampires as a metaphor for any feared or misunderstood group. It's also easy to look at them as a metaphor for a shadow organization that says one thing and has a completely different agenda on their mind, and anybody who gets in their way, they just get rid of them. Does that sound familiar?
Alan Ball     I guess in America we're so sold on this ideal of the perfect, well-adjusted family that is able to confront any conflict and, with true love and understanding, work things through. I'm sure they do exist, but I never knew any of them.
Alan Ball     There is a fetishization of victimization in our culture. And I just am not interested in victimhood.
Alan Ball     Life is suffering. We have desires and expectations and egos, and we compare the reality we have, which is miraculous and wondrous, with this reality we desire. That somehow distances us from actually taking part fully with the reality we do have, and that creates suffering. For me, the thing that I love is that it's all about the present moment.
Alan Ball     I'm at the point in my life where I don't want to work as hard. Actually, I've had to take a good hard look at workaholism and it's effect on one's mental health.
Alan Ball     I believe forgiveness is possible for everybody, for everything, but I'm a Buddhist.
Alan Ball     Vampires are total sexual metaphors; there's just no way around that.
Alan Ball     I think it's very difficult, and it requires a tremendous amount of spiritual integrity and discipline, to not be a narcissist in a culture that encourages it every step of the way.
Alan Ball     I'm 53. I don't care about high school students. I find them irritating and uninformed.
Alan Ball     Racism is ridiculous no matter where it's coming from.
Alan Ball     We live in a time where there's an alienation factor. There's a certain disconnection. We don't have any real sense of community anymore.
Alan Ball     I certainly believe that what we perceive as humans is just the tip of the iceberg. I don't necessarily believe in vampires or werewolves or that kind of thing, but I believe there is definitely a realm we don't necessarily have access to.
Alan Ball     I'm aware of 'Twilight,' but I've never seen the movies or read any of the books. Frankly, the story leaves me cold - why do a vampire story about abstinence?
Alan Ball     We live in a patriarchal culture. It's okay for women to be objectified but not for men.
Alan Ball     I'm a Buddhist, so one of my biggest beliefs is, 'Everything changes, don't take it personally.'
Alan Ball     Death is a companion for all of us, whether we acknowledge it or not, whether we're aware of it or not, and it's not necessarily a terrible thing.
Alan Ball     The difference between film and TV is the pace. You don't have the leisure of time in television.
Alan Ball     I think sexuality is a window into someone's soul.
Alan Ball     I think vampires are a timeless powerful archetype that can tap into people's psyches.
Alan Ball     And as I stumbled onto Eastern philosophy and Buddhism, it was the first time I had ever read any sort of philosophy that really made a tremendous amount of sense. What I liked that was missing from my experience of Christianity growing up was a sort of acceptance, a sort of being OK with being imperfect and not focusing on the sin.
Alan Ball     I would say try to tell stories that you care about as opposed to stories that you think will sell.
Alan Ball     Not everything is going to be successful. To strive for that is really naive. You just do the best you can do.
Alan Ball     I always choose to look, as much as one can, at the supernatural not being something that exists outside of nature, but a deeper, fundamental heart of nature that perhaps humans... have lost touch with. It's a more primal thing than perhaps we are attuned to in our modern, self-aware way of life.
Alan Dale     When I moved to Los Angeles, aged 54, I printed out Winston Churchill's phrase, 'Never, never, never give up', and stuck it on my fridge. I had no idea what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep on going.
Alan Dale     I was doing a late-night round as a milkman in 1978 when I heard a radio DJ announce that he was leaving. I marched straight to the radio station and told them I could do better. For some reason, they gave me a go.
Alan Dale     I did a production of Macbeth in the 1960s in which I had a swordfight in the final scene. But the blade fell off my sword just as I was stabbing the guy. I ended up having to hammer him to death.
Alan Dale     My wife says I'm much happier when I'm not a regular on a TV show.
Alan Dale     When you're tied to one show, you are very much at the mercy of the writers, so you can suddenly get a script where you have a heart attack and die.
Alan Dale     I came to the United States to see what would happen in 2000 after working for 20 years in Australia and asked my agent to look out for the nasty roles because I'd become famous for playing the nicest man in Australia. So I wanted to play bad guys.
Alan Davies     I like pubs too, but it's hard for me to go and get proper bladdered in the way I used to. I don't want to moan about being recognised but I do get a bit of grief sometimes.
Alan Davies     There's a lot to do when you're a kid - spiders to catch, girls to poke in the eye - stuff to be getting on with.
Alan Davies     I don't drive around London much. Any journey around Islington involves hundreds of speed bumps that seem to tear the bottom of your car off.
Alan Davies     I was hugely disappointed that 'Whites' was cancelled.
Alan Davies     I'm quite a curious person. I don't mind being the one who doesn't know things, a role I often play in QI.
Alan Davies     The principle that light can be in two places at the same time is absolutely extraordinary.
Alan Davies     My favourite restaurant is the Thai Corner Cafe on St Paul's Road. We go there all the time. I shouldn't really mention it - I don't want it to be chock-a-block.
Alan Davies     The one I remember is going into London, as it was for us in Essex, on New Year's Eve in 1981. There were four of us and we'd had a few lagers on the way. One of my mates threw up in the Tube and then stood up and fell over in it. We thought it was the funniest thing we'd ever seen.
Alan Davies     The thing I'd really like to see is the old London Bridge, with all the old buildings around it like Shakespeare's Globe. I'd like to walk along that. Don't worry, I won't get drunk and fall in.
Alan Davies     I liked the idea of all of humanity fitting inside a sugar cube because more than 99.9% of matter is space.
Alan Davies     I see myself as a comic but the acting helps sell tickets for gigs.
Alan Davies     I'm more inclined to linger in the science pages of 'The Week' magazine. But my principle obsessions are still watching sitcoms and football.
Alan Davies     I'm not a great shopper but I do buy a lot of books. I'm the publishers' friend - I buy a hundred books a year and read four.
Alan Jackson     What I enjoy doing more than anything is, I have my little antique car collection, and when the weather is pretty I like to get out one of my old cars. I have a little route I run down in the country, down Nachez Trace Parkway. The loop down through there is just really relaxing, not much traffic.
Alan Jackson     If anything good came out of 9/11, to me, was that people were so cynical about the world - all you hear about on the news is all the bad stuff everyday, but what was refreshing to me was after that, you saw how many good people there are out there. For every one bad one, there's a thousand good ones.
Alan Jackson     I think if you retire from touring then people think you are retired.
Alan Jackson     Growing up in Georgia, I used to think people up north or out west were so different. They're really not. They're just regular people who live in small towns. They grow up and try to raise families and have a job and go to church and play softball. It's that way everywhere.
Alan Jackson     I like to write sad songs. They're much easier to write and you get a lot more emotion into them. But people don't want to hear them as much. And radio definitely doesn't; they want that positive, uptempo thing.
Alan Jackson     A country song is a song about life.
Alan Jackson     I grew up with nothing, so whenever I got to where I could have something I felt like I needed to have everything I couldn't have when I was young.
Alan Jackson     For some reason I've been labeled that and it's fine, but there are a lot of other artists that sing real traditional stuff, so I don't know why they picked me. That's what I've always done.
Alan Jackson     I've always wanted to make a bluegrass album.
Alan Jackson     Oklahoma's always been good to me.
Alan Jackson     You just write about things that happen.
Alan Jackson     I mean, I am driven and laid-back at the same time.
Alan Jackson     I think every album you have, especially if it's done well, you feel like you're competing with yourself.
Alan Jackson     I'm usually just enjoying life.
Alan Jackson     Making music is still what keeps a fire going on in me.
Alan Jackson     Hee Haw was probably my biggest exposure to live music at a young age, because there wasn't any live music around my town and no one in my family played instruments.
Alan Jackson     I didn't realize until I was older what a huge music fan my daddy really was, and actually that my grandma played banjo at one time, and I didn't even know that until a year or two ago.
Alan Jackson     You have to be tough-skinned and willing to accept criticism, and at the same time, just try to do music that you like and you are proud of and not just whatever you think it's going to take to get you on the radio.
Alan Jackson     When I was in high school, I don't know that I really had big dreams.
Alan Jackson     As long as I'm still able to have a hit on the radio and sell a few albums and some tickets, I don't see that it would be worth retiring.
Alan Jackson     He's written some great songs. I thought that 'Blues Man' was a perfect song for me to do as a tribute.
Alan Jackson     I always try to make the music that I like and think my fans will like.
Alan Jackson     I mean, my girls are very sweet; I'm very proud of all of of them.
Alan Jackson     I mean, my voice has gotten a little deeper sounding as I've gotten older, I think. I noticed that.
Alan Jackson     I've always said that if you have songs on the radio and get played, you've got to have a tour to support that.
Alan Watts     The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.
Alan Watts     To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float.
Alan Watts     Things are as they are. Looking out into it the universe at night, we make no comparisons between right and wrong stars, nor between well and badly arranged constellations.
Alan Watts     No work or love will flourish out of guilt, fear, or hollowness of heart, just as no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.
Alan Watts     I have realized that the past and future are real illusions, that they exist in the present, which is what there is and all there is.
Alan Watts     How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself anything less than a god.
Alan Watts     The reason we have poverty is that we have no imagination. There are a great many people accumulating what they think is vast wealth, but it's only money... they don't know how to enjoy it, because they have no imagination.
Alan Watts     But I'll tell you what hermits realize. If you go off into a far, far forest and get very quiet, you'll come to understand that you're connected with everything.
Alan Watts     You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean.
Alan Watts     In other words, a person who is fanatic in matters of religion, and clings to certain ideas about the nature of God and the universe, becomes a person who has no faith at all.
Alan Watts     The ego is nothing other than the focus of conscious attention.
Alan Watts     You don't look out there for God, something in the sky, you look in you.
Alan Watts     Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes.
Alan Watts     Reality is only a Rorschach ink-blot, you know.
Alan Watts     Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel, for love is not ours to command.
Alan Watts     So then, the relationship of self to other is the complete realization that loving yourself is impossible without loving everything defined as other than yourself.
Alan Watts     Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.
Alan Watts     The style of God venerated in the church, mosque, or synagogue seems completely different from the style of the natural universe.
Alan Watts     We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain.
Alan Watts     But the attitude of faith is to let go, and become open to truth, whatever it might turn out to be.
Alan Watts     So the bodhisattva saves all beings, not by preaching sermons to them, but by showing them that they are delivered, they are liberated, by the act of not being able to stop changing.
Alan Watts     Some believe all that parents, tutors, and kindred believe. They take their principles by inheritance, and defend them as they would their estates, because they are born heirs to them.
Alan Watts     In known history, nobody has had such capacity for altering the universe than the people of the United States of America. And nobody has gone about it in such an aggressive way.
Alan Watts     No valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.
Alan Watts     And the attitude of faith is the very opposite of clinging to belief, of holding on.
Alastair Campbell     In an ideal world, it would not take a film star to get the media focused on mental illness.
Alastair Campbell     So here is one of my theories on happiness: we cannot know if we have lived a truly happy life until the very end. This view of life and death was reinforced by my close witnessing of the buildup to the death of Philip Gould. Philip was without doubt my closest friend in politics. When he died, I felt like I had lost a limb.
Alastair Campbell     Friends have suggested that I am the least qualified person to talk about happiness, because I am often down, and sometimes profoundly depressed. But I think that's where my qualification comes from. Because to know happiness, it helps to know unhappiness.
Alastair Campbell     My public caricature - that of a self-confident alpha male - is only partly accurate.
Alastair Campbell     My closest friend, who died not long ago, is buried near Marx's grave in Highgate cemetery, so I see the gaggle of admirers laying roses at the foot of his tombstone regularly. I have never been tempted to leave flowers there myself. Great theories, shame about the practice. Marx did many things. But inventing class was not one of them.
Alastair Campbell     My dad, Donald, was a vet and had a practice in Yorkshire. Cats and dogs were his bread and butter, but his greatest love was large animals.
Alastair Campbell     The bad news for journalists today is that the media, however seriously people who are in the public eye take it, is not taken as seriously as it once was - by the public.
Alastair Campbell     I'm certainly driven, I hate losing, I can be ruthless and short-tempered and terribly competitive.
Alastair Campbell     Like most meaningful activities, campaigns are team games.
Alastair Campbell     One in four of us will have a mental illness at some point. That is a lot of people.
Alastair Campbell     We should confine booing in sports arenas to sport. I love a good boo as much as the next football fan.
Alastair Campbell     Don't accept that you are in crisis just because everyone says you are.
Alastair Campbell     I have always been driven. I have always believed in what I believe very deeply.
Alastair Campbell     I used to be very routine-based and the new thing in my life is not having a clear, full-time existence.
Alastair Campbell     I will continue to help the political causes I believe in in any way I can.
Alastair Campbell     The day of the daredevil reporter who refuses to see obstacles to getting the truth, and seeing it with his or her own eyes, seems to have died.
Alastair Campbell     The media are obsessed with spin doctors and with portraying them as a bad thing, yet seem addicted to our medicine.
Alastair Campbell     There are many reasons for the decline in royal esteem. One is that so many of the royals are thick.
Alastair Campbell     There has been a shift to what may be defined as a culture of negativity which goes well beyond coverage of politics.
Alastair Campbell     Clinton is a big personality who has led a big life, and for some of the media conventional wisdom to boil it down to a view that 'all people are really interested in' are a few moments of madness in the Oval Office gets him, the importance of the presidency, and the significance of his life, all wrong.
Alastair Campbell     My aunty says I'm the double of my father. He was a workaholic, which I've definitely inherited. And like me, he could be the life and soul of the party, but also quite withdrawn.
Alastair Campbell     May I share with you my earliest memory of a political row? It was with my mother, about the Queen - classic Freudian stuff, shrinks would say. I was eight, and refusing to watch the Queen's Christmas Day broadcast.
Alastair Campbell     There is something in me that makes me see things through.
Alastair Campbell     To me, marriage is partly a religious thing and I'm not religious.
Alastair Campbell     Failure, it is thought, is what sells, and what people want to hear and read about. I am not so sure.
Alber Elbaz     Run away from laziness; work hard. Touch intuition and listen to the heart, not marketing directors. Dream.
Alber Elbaz     To be a fashion critic is easy because you just say, 'I love it, I hate it,' but life is more than love and hate.
Alber Elbaz     For me, the sketching of dresses was about fantasy and dreams. In my little room at home, I felt that I was somewhere else. In Paris, for instance.
Alber Elbaz     If you take something out of the freezer, it's cold, but what happens when it melts? It's a cool party, a cool person, a cool collection. What does that mean? I'm more interested in things that are uncool, things that have a certain individuality, a certain soul, a certain longevity, emotion, fragility.
Alber Elbaz     I love to see old women. I love wrinkles. I love gray hair.
Alber Elbaz     Why not touch things that we hate and turn them upside down and inside out?
Alber Elbaz     I certainly can't complain. I work six days a week, if not seven, and eighteen hours out of twenty-four - fortunately, with a great deal of pleasure. Why? Because I only do something if I want to do it; I need to feel a desire, to find pleasure in moving forward, creating, moving, inventing.
Alber Elbaz     I like having the freedom to dress as I desire.
Alber Elbaz     Fashion doesn't look good only on models; it can look good on different people of different ages and different body shapes.
Alber Elbaz     Fashion is not always about what's new, it's also about what's good. And I think if you need to see what's good, you have to be there.
Alber Elbaz     For me, Lancome was more than just a brand. There was something very nostalgic about the name, about the whole story.
Alber Elbaz     I adore women, and the one thing I want to do more than anything is to see a transformation of personality when someone puts on one of my dresses.
Alber Elbaz     I hate bridges. I'm always very insecure on bridges.
Alber Elbaz     I hate the word 'cool.' It gives me a rash.
Alber Elbaz     I think that if you want to pass emotion, you have to write a letter. Emotions do not pass in SMS or in e-mail.
Alber Elbaz     I've always said fashion is like roast chicken: You don't have to think about it to know it's delicious.
Alber Elbaz     If I am in a beautiful place, but I don't like the people, I am miserable.
Alber Elbaz     I want to know where is that committee in Switzerland that sits to decide what is in and what is out. I don't listen to the formula makers. I think maybe I have a selective hearing disorder.
Alber Elbaz     Almost every collection I do has 200 different references. I don't have two of the same coat, two of the same dress. I have it in one color, in one fabric. I've tried to adapt the culture of couture, and the know-how and the heritage, but I try to update it.
Alber Elbaz     I barely finish one pre-collection before I must start on another. Sales start, but I am already elsewhere creatively. The men's show is being prepared, but we also need to think about accessories, perfumes and other items. In sum, I never stop.
Alber Elbaz     Many, many times I find that whatever is looking good on the screen doesn't always look or feel good on the body. So who do we design for - do we design for the screen, or do we design for women?
Alber Elbaz     One woman told me that every time she wears Lanvin, men fall in love with her. Another told me she wore Lanvin to face her husband's lawyer because she felt protected. If I can make men fall in love with women and if I can protect women, I think I can die peacefully.
Alber Elbaz     When I was either 7 or 8 years old, I did a sketch every day of my teacher and what she wore. At the end of the year, I gave her the sketchbook. For me, the sketching of dresses was about fantasy and dreams.
Alber Elbaz     I am very much a people person.
Alber Elbaz     All I want is beautiful. I mean, I like grey hair, I love wrinkles. But this is me.
Albert Camus     Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.
Albert Camus     You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.
Albert Camus     In the depth of winter I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer.
Albert Camus     The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.
Albert Camus     But what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads?
Albert Camus     Blessed are the hearts that can bend; they shall never be broken.
Albert Camus     You cannot create experience. You must undergo it.
Albert Camus     Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower.
Albert Camus     Nothing is more despicable than respect based on fear.
Albert Camus     The evil that is in the world almost always comes of ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence if they lack understanding.
Albert Camus     I know of only one duty, and that is to love.
Albert Camus     I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn't, than live as if there isn't and to die to find out that there is.
Albert Camus     A man without ethics is a wild beast loosed upon this world.
Albert Camus     It is necessary to fall in love... if only to provide an alibi for all the random despair you are going to feel anyway.
Albert Camus     Basically, at the very bottom of life, which seduces us all, there is only absurdity, and more absurdity. And maybe that's what gives us our joy for living, because the only thing that can defeat absurdity is lucidity.
Albert Camus     Those who lack the courage will always find a philosophy to justify it.
Albert Camus     For centuries the death penalty, often accompanied by barbarous refinements, has been trying to hold crime in check; yet crime persists. Why? Because the instincts that are warring in man are not, as the law claims, constant forces in a state of equilibrium.
Albert Camus     Every act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being.
Albert Camus     In order to exist, man must rebel, but rebellion must respect the limits that it discovers in itself - limits where minds meet, and in meeting, begin to exist.
Albert Camus     A free press can, of course, be good or bad, but, most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad.
Albert Camus     All great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning. Great works are often born on a street corner or in a restaurant's revolving door.
Albert Camus     It's a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.

Albert Ellis     The art of love is largely the art of persistence.

Alden Ehrenreich     For me, the drive is storytelling. To be a part of an art that tells a story and to be a catalyst, a color in that, is very exciting.
Alden Ehrenreich     I haven't worked enough to worry about getting typecast, but I do as a film lover didn't want to be working with the bad guys. I didn't want to be making a movie I thought was contributing to a lower base of movies that I just didn't think were helping people, really.
Alden Ehrenreich     The aspect of kind of living in your imagination and creating a more romantic vision of the world than the reality that you're given - that's definitely something I can sort of relate to.
Alden Ehrenreich     I feel about romance the same way I do about a vocation; it's a calling.
Alden Ehrenreich     Some movies, I think, present ideas of the world that just don't help people with their lives. They just present things that are fleeting or stupid. So that's what I'm careful about - making sure I'm part of something that is saying something that I think is valuable in the world of people, not necessarily in the world of art.
Alden Ehrenreich     When I was a little kid, my parents would show me Marx Brothers' films and westerns and stuff like that. That's where all my desire to be an actor comes from and probably most of my understanding of acting comes from for sure.
Alden Ehrenreich     I'm an actor because I love movies, and always have loved movies. I'm a film buff.
Alden Ehrenreich     I really think that movies are the most popular form of story telling ever and have such a huge impact on culture when they do. So I really want to be a part of those movies that say something good to a lot of people.
Alden Ehrenreich     I would say that it's mainly about the director. It's a hard quality to find, but I always know whether I want to do something or not. The character is important to me, as is getting to work with people that I feel like I can learn from and make a great movie with.
